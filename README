# Playlist

This C project loads a playlist from a text file, stores the songs inside a singly linked list, lets you remove and insert songs, and then saves the modified playlist back to a new text file. The learning goal for me here is mostly to practice pointers, linked lists, memory management, and file I/O in C.

The input file is called "playlist.txt" and each line in it is one track. The output is written to "playlist-out.txt" after the program deletes one track and inserts a new one.

The core data structure is a singly linked list. Each node has a void\* data pointer where we store a dynamically allocated char array with the song name. The node also has a 'next' pointer pointing to the next node. Because data is a void pointer, the list can store any kind of data if needed.

## Some functions

The project uses a few key functions in singly_linked_list.c.
insert_at: this function inserts a node at a specific index. If you pass index 0, the new node becomes the new head of the list.
delete_at: deletes a node at a given index and returns the pointer to the data. The caller has to free the data.
node_at: returns a pointer to the node at index n.
tail: walks to the end of the list and returns the last node.

In main.c, the program first loads the playlist using load_file. This function opens the text file, reads each line, removes the newline, allocates a new node and data buffer, copies the song text into it, and appends it to the list.

After loading, the playlist is printed to the terminal. Then one song is removed with delete_at to demonstrate its functionality, and a new song is inserted with insert_at. Then save_file writes all tracks back to a new file, one song per line. There is also free_playlist, which goes through the list and deletes each node from the head until the list is empty. This avoids memory leaks.
